Generate a Lecture Scribe for exam-ready reference material for a last-time reading notes. And it must be useful for revise whole lecture using this generated scribe and strictly not use any data from other sources or web. Must use only this lecture pdf as sources. Use only the content explicitly present in the provided PDF lecture material, without consulting or relying on any external sources or prior knowledge. Do not infer missing steps, complete partial arguments or add intermediate reasoning that is not written in the pdf. Include definitions, assumptions, notations, and theorem or proposition statements exactly as they appear in the PDF, and include proofs, derivations and worked examples only when they are explicitly given in the PDF without adding, changing or extending anything. If a derivation, proof or argument skips steps on the slides then scribe must skip those same steps. Do not fill in gaps or smooth the logic. Include only what appears on the PPT slides, in the same order as shown. Include definitions, notation, assumptions and conditions exactly as written on the slides. Write all theorems, propositions or similar results in the same form as shown. Copy proofs, derivations and worked examples in the same order as showing steps only where the slides show them and do not add explanations or change the structure. Follow the lecture flow strictly: topics that continue across multiple slides must be treated as one continuous section and slide breaks should not be treated as topic breaks. Keep all main headings from the PPT, group sub-headings only when needed to maintain flow and do not add new headings. Preserve all notations exactly as shown, including any inconsistencies and do not rename symbols or clean up expressions. If content is unclear or incomplete in the lecture, then keep it that way. When equations or derivations span multiple slides write them as one continuous sequence in the original order.Produce the complete lecture scribe as one clear document. Do not give partial output. Do not add comments about the process or explain any rules.
